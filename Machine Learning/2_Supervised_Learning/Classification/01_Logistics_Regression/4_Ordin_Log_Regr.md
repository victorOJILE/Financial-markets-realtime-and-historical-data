## Ordinal Logistic Regression
This is also a generalization of binary logistic regression for classification problems with three or more categories, but it is used when the categories have a clear, meaningful order. 

The difference between the categories is not necessarily equal, but the ranking is consistent. Use when your categories are ordinal (ordered).

#### .
#### Examples
- A student's grade in a course: "A," "B," "C," "D," or "F." The order is clear, but the "distance" between an "A" and a "B" might not be the same as the "distance" between a "D" and an "F."
- Customer satisfaction ratings on a scale: "Very Dissatisfied," "Dissatisfied," "Neutral," "Satisfied," "Very Satisfied."
- Movie ratings on a star scale: 1 star, 2 stars, 3 stars, 4 stars, 5 stars.

### How it works
Ordinal logistic regression is more efficient than multinomial regression for ordered data because it takes the order into account. It doesn't treat each category as a separate, unrelated entity.

`Cumulative Probabilities:` Instead of predicting the probability of being in a specific category, the model predicts the cumulative probability of being at or below a certain category. For a 5-star rating system, it would predict:
- The probability of a rating being 1 star.
- The probability of a rating being 1 or 2 stars.
- The probability of a rating being 1, 2, or 3 stars.

And so on.

`"Best Fit" Thresholds:` The model uses a single set of coefficients for all the features, but it learns different "thresholds" or "cut-points" to separate the categories.

These thresholds are like dividing lines on a number line that determine the cumulative probabilities. The algorithm finds the optimal thresholds that best separate the ordered categories.

---
`The Proportional Odds Assumption:` The model assumes that the effect of an independent variable (e.g., movie budget) on the odds of being in a higher category versus a lower category is the same across all of the thresholds. 

This is called the proportional odds assumption, and it's a key part of what makes ordinal regression simpler and more powerful for ordered data.

### Example
For ordinal regression, we will use the mord library, as it is a popular and straightforward choice in Python for this specific task. 

We'll use a hypothetical dataset for predicting student grades, which is a perfect example of ordered categories.

---
First, you'll need to install the library if you haven't already:
pip install mord

```
import numpy as np
from mord import LogisticAT # LogisticAT is a common ordinal regression model
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# --- 1. Generate synthetic data ---
# Let's create a dataset to predict student grades based on study hours and attendance.
# The grades are ordinal: 0=F, 1=D, 2=C, 3=B, 4=A
np.random.seed(42)
num_students = 500

# Features: Study hours (more hours -> better grade) and Attendance rate (higher rate -> better grade)
study_hours = np.random.normal(loc=10, scale=3, size=num_students)
attendance_rate = np.random.uniform(low=0.5, high=1.0, size=num_students)

# Target: Grades. We'll simulate a positive relationship.
# The formula is a simplified way to generate ordered grades.
# We'll add some noise to make it more realistic.
grades = (study_hours * 0.4 + attendance_rate * 5 + np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=2, size=num_students) - 5).astype(int)

# Clip the grades to be within our valid range [0, 4]
grades[grades < 0] = 0
grades[grades > 4] = 4

X = np.column_stack((study_hours, attendance_rate))
y = grades

# --- 2. Split the data ---
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# --- 3. Create and train the model ---
# Use LogisticAT, a common ordinal regression model from the mord library.
# It stands for "All Thresholds."
model_ordinal = LogisticAT()

# The fit method trains the model to learn the optimal coefficients and thresholds.
model_ordinal.fit(X_train, y_train)

# --- 4. Make predictions ---
y_pred = model_ordinal.predict(X_test)

# --- 5. Evaluate the model ---
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("--- Ordinal Logistic Regression ---")
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}\n")

# --- 6. Predict a new data point ---
# Let's predict the grade for a new student with:
# 12 study hours and 0.95 attendance rate
new_student = np.array([[12, 0.95]])
predicted_grade_index = model_ordinal.predict(new_student)
grade_names = ['F', 'D', 'C', 'B', 'A']

print(f"Predicted grade index for new student: {predicted_grade_index[0]}")
print(f"Predicted grade: {grade_names[predicted_grade_index[0]]}")
```

### .
Ordinal Logistic Regression requires a dedicated library like mord.

The mord.LogisticAT class is specifically designed to handle the ordered nature of the categories, which is more efficient and appropriate for this type of data.

Notice that the predict_proba method is often not a direct feature in ordinal regression models in the same way, as the model focuses on the cumulative probabilities and thresholds.
