## Label encoding 
This is a fundamental data preprocessing technique used to convert categorical data into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models.

Many algorithms cannot process non-numeric values, making encoding a necessary step when working with features such as colors, cities or product types.

#### .
#### For example
In a dataset with a Fruit column containing "Apple," "Banana," and "Orange," label encoding can map:

| | |
|---|---|
|Apple | 0|
|Banana | 1|
|Orange | 2|

### .
### Understanding Label Encoding
Categorical data is broadly divided into two types:
- **Nominal Data:** Categories without inherent order (e.g., colors: red, blue, green).
- **Ordinal Data:** Categories with a natural order (e.g., satisfaction levels: low, medium, high).

---
Label encoding works best for ordinal data, where the assigned numbers reflect the order. However, applying it to nominal data can unwantedly suggest an order (e.g., Red = 0, Blue = 1, Green = 2), which may mislead algorithms like linear regression. 

Thus, the choice of encoding must align with the data type and the algorithm used.

### .
### When to Use Label Encoding
Label encoding is particularly valuable when:
- **Encoding ordinal features:** Numbers can capture the inherent order of categories.
- **Using tree-based algorithms:** Models like decision trees or random forests are insensitive to numerical order assumptions.
- **Memory efficiency is critical:** Each category is stored as a single integer, unlike one-hot encoding which expands data into multiple columns.

---
For nominal data and algorithms sensitive to numerical values, one-hot encoding is often a better alternative.

### .
### Implementing Label Encoding
Python provides two primary ways to perform label encoding: scikit-learn's LabelEncoder and pandas’ Categorical type.

#### Using scikit-learn’s LabelEncoder

```
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
import pandas as pd

# Sample dataset
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Fruit': ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange', 'Apple', 'Orange', 'Banana'],
    'Price': [1.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.3, 0.9, 0.6]
})

# Initialize and fit LabelEncoder
le = LabelEncoder()
data['Fruit_Encoded'] = le.fit_transform(data['Fruit'])

print(data)
print("Category Mapping:", le.classes_)
```
**Output:**
>  

The fit_transform method both learns the unique categories and applies the encoding, while the classes_ attribute stores the mapping for future reference.

#### Using pandas’ Categorical Type

```
# Encode using pandas categorical type
data['Fruit_Encoded_Pandas'] = data['Fruit'].astype('category').cat.codes

print(data)
print("Category Mapping:", dict(enumerate(data['Fruit'].astype('category').cat.categories)))
```
**Output:**
>  

This approach is simpler for pandas-based workflows and does not require an external library.

### .
### Encoding Ordinal Data
When dealing with ordinal data, a custom mapping ensures the numeric values preserve order:

```
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Satisfaction': ['Low', 'High', 'Medium', 'Low', 'High'],
    'Score': [3, 8, 5, 2, 9]
})

satisfaction_order = {'Low': 0, 'Medium': 1, 'High': 2}
data['Satisfaction_Encoded'] = data['Satisfaction'].map(satisfaction_order)

print(data)
```
**Output:**
>  

This approach is ideal for features where the order carries semantic meaning.

### .
### Performance and Limitations
Label encoding is computationally efficient. Both LabelEncoder and pandas' Categorical require a single scan of the data (O(n)) to map categories.

### .
### Limitations
- **Nominal data misinterpretation:** Encoded integers can imply false order; one-hot encoding is safer for nominal features.
- **Missing values:** These must be handled prior to encoding.
- **Unseen categories in test data:** Encoders will fail if new categories appear; handle this with a default value or ensure training includes all possible categories.
- **High cardinality:** Features with many unique categories may still require additional feature engineering.

### .
### Best Practices
- Apply label encoding primarily to ordinal features or tree-based models.
- Handle missing values before encoding.
- Save the encoder or category mapping to enable inverse transformation during evaluation or deployment.
- For nominal features in algorithms sensitive to numerical relationships, use one-hot encoding instead.
