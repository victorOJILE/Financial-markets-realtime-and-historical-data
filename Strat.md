## Identifying & Trading Trends

#### 1. Determine Dominant Trend (Bigger Picture)

- Focus on 4H or 1H charts.

## .
`Method 1: Trend Lines:`
- Draw trend lines connecting at least two (in higher tf and three in smaller ones (15M or 5M)) or more significant swing highs (for downtrends) or swing lows (for uptrends).

#### Uptrend
Price is generally making higher highs (HH) and higher lows (HL), and stays above an ascending trend line.



# .


#### Uptrend
Consistently see HHs followed by HLs.

#### Downtrend
Consistently see LLs followed by LHs.

#### Why this is important
This step sets your bias. You'll primarily look for trades with this bigger trend, or a significant reversal of it.

#### 2. Continuation Entries (Trading WITH the Trend)
> Price is in a clear trend (from Step 1) and is pulling back to a key area.

`Trigger 1: Trend Line Test:`

Wait for price to return to and "test" your established trend line.

`Trigger 2: Rejection Pattern + Volume Spike:`

At the trend line, look for clear signs of rejection (e.g., strong candlestick wicks, engulfing patterns).

#### Crucially
> This rejection should be accompanied by a significant increase in trading volume.

This indicates institutional interest defending that level.

`Confirmation 1: Point of Interest (POI) Confluence:`

Is the trend line test and rejection happening at a well-defined POI?

#### Fair Value Gap (FVG)
An inefficiency in price where buying/selling was one-sided, often acts as support/resistance.

#### Order Block (OB)
A specific candlestick or group of candlesticks where significant institutional orders were placed, often marking reversal points.

`Confirmation 2: SMT Divergence (Smart Money Technique):`

This is an advanced confirmation. Look for divergence between correlated assets (e.g., EURUSD and DXY, or EURUSD and GBPUSD or XAUUSD and XAUEUR).

### Your Entry
> Once all these align (Trend line test, rejection + volume, POI, SMT), you have a high-probability continuation setup.

#### 3. Executing Reversal Entries (with Confirmation)
> The dominant trend (from Step 1) appears to be losing momentum and showing signs of a change.

`Trigger 1: Market Structure Shift (MSS):`

This is the first and most important signal. For an uptrend, price must break below a significant swing low (creating a lower low).

#### Crucially
This MSS must also break your established trend line from Step 1. This adds significant weight to the reversal idea.

`Trigger 2: Return to POI (Retest):`

After the MSS, wait for price to "retest" or return to a newly formed POI. This POI is often the order block or FVG that initiated the MSS.

`Confirmation 1: Volume Spike at POI:`

As price retests the POI, look for a significant volume spike. This indicates renewed institutional activity at that level, either defending the new direction or trapping those trying to fade it.

`Confirmation 2: SMT Divergence:`

Similar to continuation, look for SMT divergence that confirms the new direction.

### Your Entry
> Once the MSS occurs, price retests the POI with volume, and SMT confirms, you have a high-probability reversal setup.

### Key Takeaways to Keep it Simple:

- Start Big. Always know your dominant trend (4H/1H). This is your compass.

- Patience is Key. Don't chase trades. Wait for price to come to your levels (trend lines, POIs).

- Confluence is Power. Don't just rely on one signal. The more confirmations (trend line, volume, POI, SMT), the higher the probability.

- Volume is Your Friend. It tells you where the big money is involved. Always look for that spike.

- SMT Divergence is Advanced, But Powerful. Use it as an extra layer of conviction once you're comfortable with the other elements. If it complicates things too much initially, you can focus on the first three confirmations, then add SMT later.

- Practice on Historical Data. Before going live, backtest this strategy thoroughly. See how it performs across different markets and time periods. This builds confidence and helps you internalize the patterns.
